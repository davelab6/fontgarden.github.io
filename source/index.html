            NFT’s and Free Fonts
          </h2>
          <p class="mt-4">
            The problem of monetizing digital content is reproducible
            information is effectively infinite in supply, leaving it impossible
            to price, free like air. Primitive attempts at digital monetization
            try to create an artificial scarcity through paywalls and DRM,
            technically ineffective against any piracy but backed by socialized
            pressure and threats of legal action. These models of course
            restrict the free flow of information and suppress the memetic
            cultural nature of fonts as an art form.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            NFT’s are an alternative form of creating artificial digital
            scarcity, so it’s easy to make the intuitive leap that they also
            negatively limit free information. However, by changing the value
            proposition of digital goods from a scarcity based on limiting
            information access to one based on provable provenance, they have no
            need to rely on gatekeeping access to NFT content to secure value.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Blockchain is a naturalistic technology, it would have been
            developed in a thousand timelines, just as the CPU would have, just
            as double-entry accounting or abstracted money would have—or AI
            will—but copyright law was a confusing and awkward historical
            aberration.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            Digital scarcity instituted by legal infrastructure was an awkward,
            artificial, and ethically problematic intervention on the free flow
            of information; NFTs managing scarcity as trustless bookkeeping
            allows accessibility to be achieved without undermining production
            incentives.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4">
            NFT’s solve the problem of trustless digital deeds of ownership,
            making the need to conflate ownership with content accessibility in
            copyable digital media outmoded—and with it, convoluted and invasive
            DRM solutions, unclear licensing rights and likely one day,
            paywalling altogether.
